All notable changes to the riboseq utilities will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/),

## [0.2.0] - 2017-03-21
### Changed
- The filenames for the motif reports have been completely changed from the
  previous format. In particular, any additional analysis of existing motifs
  will need to use version `0.1.2` of this library.


## [0.1.2] and previous versions

The initial versions have not been documented in the change long. They include
all of the utilities required to run the version of Rp-Bp used in the paper, as
well as things such as filenames which are compatible with early versions of the
B-tea pipeline.
